## Migrating a new token to Cardano

If you are a blockchain project or a company that is interested in migrating your ERC20 tokens to Cardano (and they are not on the list), you can apply for a new token migration.

1. Go to the [ERC20 converter](http://kovan-bridge.singularitynet.io/). On the home page click ‘. . .’ to display the menu, then click ‘Migrate tokens’.
2. Fill in the details on the form and click ‘Submit request’:

![8-migrate-token](https://ucarecdn.com/72716798-0b36-4264-8239-e38651b30ff2/)

**Form details:**

+ Mandatory fields: E-mail, Name, Surname, Organization, Contract hash.
+ Mandatory field values are validated once ‘Submit request’ is clicked.
+ Contract hash field: add the contract hash of your Ethereum mainnet ERC20 token and click ‘Enter’.  

For example, in CoinGecko: 

![9-coingecko-contract](https://ucarecdn.com/8dd55dfc-51dc-4a15-b54a-75167008137a/)

In Etherscan:

![10-etherscan](https://ucarecdn.com/55906960-ec0d-4719-9cae-a7fde405d06a/)

You can add several tokens in one migration request:
